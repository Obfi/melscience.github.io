step_by_step: |
  1. Pour some distilled water (about 300 ml) into the flask and dissolve 8 grams of sodium hydroxide (or potassium hydroxide).
  2. Dissolve 10 grams of glucose in this solution.
  3. Prepare indigo carmine water solution (0.25 g in 25 mL distilled water) in another flask.
  4. Pour the indigo carmine solution into the flask with glucose and base solution.
  5. The solution changes color from green to yellow, passing through red.
  6. Shake the flask moderately – the solution becomes red and then returns to yellow.
  7. Shake the flask intensively – the solution becomes green, then red, then yellow. You can repeat shaking several times.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles.
  Prevent skin contact with base solutions.
science_background: |
  The oxidized form of indigo carmine is green in an alkaline solution. The indicator reduces in a glucose alkaline solution. The intermediate form of indigo carmine is red. The fully reduced form of the indicator is yellow.
  When the flask is shaken, oxygen from air dissolves in the solution and oxidizes indigo carmine. Solution becomes red if a small amount of oxygen is dissolved (moderate shaking), and green if all of indigo carmine was oxidized (intensive shaking).
